# Planning & organisation
Initially to start with coming up with ideas and components for this application we brainstormed for about 5-10 minutes. Any idea that came to mind we put down and then narrowed it down upon review.
<h3></h3>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97416784/160837626-f27d783c-92d7-458c-a6ff-e3fbc33345d7.JPG" width="1000">
We then started to wireframe what we wanted the application to look like, this become our minimal viable product.

In this planning process we also thought about how we want our API to look, the data structure and the fields needed. The user will have an array of events they have joined and habits they have completed. The event will have an array of users joined (members) and habits completed. The habit completed will have the owner (user that created the habit) and the associated event.

We then started to move onto Trello to plan out our time for this project. How we will work and who will be working on what. We all made a valuable contribution to complete the back end. Then we were able to start to split up the work when we moved onto the front end. I was mainly responsible for helping to build the back end, implementing the image uploader using cloudinary, designing the front end profile page pages for users, adding the habits completed feed, ensuring you are able to edit and delete where necessary, seeding the users and also bug fixing.

To work together on the code as a group we used branches on GitHub and then when merging to the development branch. We tried our best to not work on the same files at the same time and whenever we did have merge conflicts we reviewed them as a group. Every morning we had a stand up on zoom to discuss how we were getting on with the work and organising what everyone is doing. This really helped to prevent conflicts and productivity. It was a great team working experience and I'm happy with how we work together. 

# Code examples
Register a user and Logging in (Server side):

```javascript
export const registerUser = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const newUser = await User.create(req.body)
    console.log(newUser)
    const token = jwt.sign({ sub: newUser._id }, process.env.SECRET, { expiresIn: '7 days' })
    return res.status(202).json({ message: 'Registration Successful',token: token  })
    
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err)
    return res.status(422).json(err)
  }
}

export const loginUser = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { email, password } = req.body
    console.log(req.body)
    const userToLogin = await User.findOne({ email: email })
    console.log(userToLogin)
    // console.log(userToLogin.validatePassword(password))
    if (!userToLogin || !userToLogin.validatePassword(password)) {
      return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Unauthorised' })
    }
    const token = jwt.sign({ sub: userToLogin._id }, process.env.SECRET, { expiresIn: '7 days' })
    return res.status(200).json({ message: `Welcome back, ${userToLogin.firstName}`, token: token })
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err)
    return res.status(401).json(err)
  }
}
```

User schema (Server side):

```javascript
const userSchema = new Schema({
  firstName: { type: String, required: true, maxlength: 30 },
  lastName: { type: String, required: true, maxlength: 30 },
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  profilePicture: { type: String },
  habitCompletions: [habitSchema],
  // events: [joinedGroupSchema],
  events: [{ event: { type: Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'Event' } }],
})
```

Get the data for the user that is logged in (Client side):

```javascript
 useEffect(() => {
        const getLoggedInProfile = async () => {
            try {
                const token = localStorage.getItem('tinyhabits-token')
                console.log(token)
                const { data } = await axios.get(`/api/profile`, {
                    headers: {
                        Authorization: `Bearer ${getTokenFromLocalStorage()}`,
                    }
                })
                // console.log('data', data)
                setLoggedInProfile(data)
            } catch (err) {
                console.log(err)
            }
        }
        getLoggedInProfile()
    }, [])
```

# Key learning and takeaways
Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in collaborating within a software development team and utilising essential tools like GitHub and branching. One of the most rewarding aspects was mastering the installation and utilisation of MongoDB to create and seed databases for the backend, which was entirely new to me. Working with a styling framework, namely Chakra, was also a first for me, and although it took some practice, I found myself enjoying the process of CSS styling within this framework.

Undertaking this project was a significant milestone in my collaborative coding journey. Despite encountering challenges in the form of conflicting ideas and visions, managing divergent branches, and dealing with conflicting code, I learned the immense value of collective problem-solving. Collaborating with others allowed us to spot errors or find solutions more quickly, especially when someone was stuck and needed a fresh perspective.

## Embracing Collaborative Git Workflows
Our journey with Git brought a profound shift in our understanding and utilisation of this powerful version control system. Through collaboration, we delved into the intricacies of branching, merging, and resolving conflicts. When faced with challenges, we found solace in diving into documentation, ultimately empowering ourselves to harness Git's full potential.

## Unveiling the Power of Node/Express
Embarking on our first substantial practical encounter with Node and Express, we discovered a newfound appreciation for these tools. By dedicating a full day to construct and test routes and controllers using Insomnia, we gained valuable insights into the inner workings of these technologies. Though our journey with Node was still in its infancy, we managed to effectively access and utilise the necessary data on the front-end, paving the way for future optimisation.

## Unleashing Flexibility with MongoDB/Mongoose
Venturing into uncharted territory with MongoDB and Mongoose proved to be a captivating yet challenging experience. At first, the flexibility of data model development overwhelmed us, as we grappled with finding the "perfect" approach. However, as we progressed, we discovered the liberation of embracing diverse schemas and relationships. The NoSQL approach eventually revealed its advantages, especially when adapting to evolving requirements.

## Advancing Proficiency in React
While we had prior experience with React, this project elevated our understanding to new heights. The project's complexity demanded mastery of state management with hooks, particularly when implementing functionalities like likes and comments. We were captivated by the intricate interplay between front-end data manipulation and backend communication.

## Embracing Chakra UI for Rapid Development
In pursuit of an efficient UI framework for our project, we embraced Chakra UI, a decision that we found to be highly rewarding. The framework's ease of use and compatibility with our required features made the development process smoother. We particularly admired its flexibility in restyling components and ensuring a responsive design.

## Unleashing Creativity with Vanilla JavaScript
A crowning achievement in our project was the habit completion progress widget. This endeavour pushed our JavaScript skills to new horizons as we engaged in generating dynamic divs, styling them conditionally, and leveraging array methods like mapping and filtering. While we acknowledge the potential for backend optimisation, the experience provided a unique opportunity to master JS methods and access nested data effectively.

## Empowering with Cloudinary Upload API
Navigating the unexplored territory of Cloudinary, we unlocked the potential of integrating file upload functionality. Through React state management and Cloudinary account credentials, we seamlessly facilitated the addition of uploaded image URLs to the backend. This achievement marked yet another milestone in our journey of continuous learning and growth.
