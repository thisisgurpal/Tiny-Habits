# Planning & organisation
Initially we immersed ourselves in an invigorating brainstorming session. For approximately 5-10 minutes, our minds ran wild, and we unleashed every idea that struck us. No thought was too big or too small; we eagerly jotted them all down. After this exhilarating brainstorm, we thoughtfully reviewed our myriad of ideas, carefully selecting the ones that resonated the most. This process of exploration and refinement laid the foundation for our exciting project ahead.<h3></h3>

During the meticulous planning process, we devoted considerable thought to crafting our API's structure, data format, and required fields. The envisioned API would facilitate a seamless user experience, empowering users to access an array of events they've joined and their completed habits.

To ensure increased functionality, we designed each event to include an array of joined users (members) and completed habits. These interconnected elements would provide a holistic view of the users' engagement within the application.

Moreover, we carefully considered the habit completed data, intending to capture both the habit's owner (the user who created it) and its associated event. This comprehensive data structure would facilitate efficient data management and enable users to track their habits and event participation with ease.

To improve collaboration, we harnessed the power of GitHub branches to work collectively on the code. By creating separate branches for our individual tasks, we ensured a structured development process. When ready, we merged our changes into the development branch, keeping the codebase cohesive and organized.

To avoid overlapping efforts, we made a conscious effort not to work on the same files simultaneously. In case of merge conflicts, we proactively reviewed and resolved them as a group. This collaborative approach helped maintain code integrity and minimized disruptions.

Daily stand-up meetings on Zoom became a cornerstone of our team's rhythm. Each morning, we gathered to discuss progress, challenges, and upcoming tasks. This open communication allowed us to synchronize our efforts, prevent conflicts, and enhance productivity.

Our teamwork experience was truly gratifying, and the synergy among the team members contributed to the project's success. The camaraderie and dedication we exhibited reinforced our belief in the power of collaboration, leaving us content with the results of our collective efforts.

# Key learning and takeaways
Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in collaborating within a software development team and utilising essential tools like GitHub and branching. One of the most rewarding aspects was mastering the installation and utilisation of MongoDB to create and seed databases for the backend, which was entirely new to me. Working with a styling framework, namely Chakra, was also a first for me, and although it took some practice, I found myself enjoying the process of CSS styling within this framework.

Undertaking this project was a significant milestone in my collaborative coding journey. Despite encountering challenges in the form of conflicting ideas and visions, managing divergent branches, and dealing with conflicting code, I learned the immense value of collective problem-solving. Collaborating with others allowed us to spot errors or find solutions more quickly, especially when someone was stuck and needed a fresh perspective.

## Embracing Collaborative Git Workflows
Our journey with Git brought a profound shift in our understanding and utilisation of this powerful version control system. Through collaboration, we delved into the intricacies of branching, merging, and resolving conflicts. When faced with challenges, we found solace in diving into documentation, ultimately empowering ourselves to harness Git's full potential.

## Unveiling the Power of Node/Express
Embarking on our first substantial practical encounter with Node and Express, we discovered a newfound appreciation for these tools. By dedicating a full day to construct and test routes and controllers using Insomnia, we gained valuable insights into the inner workings of these technologies. Though our journey with Node was still in its infancy, we managed to effectively access and utilise the necessary data on the front-end, paving the way for future optimisation.

## Unleashing Flexibility with MongoDB/Mongoose
Venturing into uncharted territory with MongoDB and Mongoose proved to be a captivating yet challenging experience. At first, the flexibility of data model development overwhelmed us, as we grappled with finding the "perfect" approach. However, as we progressed, we discovered the liberation of embracing diverse schemas and relationships. The NoSQL approach eventually revealed its advantages, especially when adapting to evolving requirements.

## Advancing Proficiency in React
While we had prior experience with React, this project elevated our understanding to new heights. The project's complexity demanded mastery of state management with hooks, particularly when implementing functionalities like likes and comments. We were captivated by the intricate interplay between front-end data manipulation and backend communication.

## Embracing Chakra UI for Rapid Development
In pursuit of an efficient UI framework for our project, we embraced Chakra UI, a decision that we found to be highly rewarding. The framework's ease of use and compatibility with our required features made the development process smoother. We particularly admired its flexibility in restyling components and ensuring a responsive design.

## Unleashing Creativity with Vanilla JavaScript
A crowning achievement in our project was the habit completion progress widget. This endeavour pushed our JavaScript skills to new horizons as we engaged in generating dynamic divs, styling them conditionally, and leveraging array methods like mapping and filtering. While we acknowledge the potential for backend optimisation, the experience provided a unique opportunity to master JS methods and access nested data effectively.

## Empowering with Cloudinary Upload API
Navigating the unexplored territory of Cloudinary, we unlocked the potential of integrating file upload functionality. Through React state management and Cloudinary account credentials, we seamlessly facilitated the addition of uploaded image URLs to the backend. This achievement marked yet another milestone in our journey of continuous learning and growth.
