# General Assembly Project 3 - TinyHabits
My third project at General Assembly was with a group, and we chose to develop a habit app that allows you to join upcoming 30 day habit challenges using React, Node JS, Express JS and MongoDB (MERN stack). You will be able to register, create a profile then add your habits to events when they are live and also comment on events. For this project I helped create our own API of events, users and habits. My main responsibilities were to help build the back end, bug fixing, design the front end profile page pages for users and the comment feed, as well as ensuring you are able to edit and delete where necessary. The idea behind this application is to help others build a habit, something that can a lot of us can find difficult and struggle with.

# Brief
* Build a full-stack application using an Express API to serve our data from a Mongo database. 
* Consume our API with a seperate front-end build in react.
* Have visually impressive design.

# Technologies used
JavaScript, MongoDB, Mongoose, jsonwebtoken, Express, Node.js, React, Chakra, Axios, SASS, CSS.

# Approach taken
<h3>Planning</h3>
Initially to start with comming up with ideas and compenents for this application we brain stormed for about 5-10 minutes. Any idea that comes to mind we put down and then narrowed it down upon reviewing.

We then started to wireframe what we wanted the application to look like, this is going to be our minimal viable product.

In this planning process we also thought about how we want our API to look, the data structure and teh fields needed. The user will have an array of events they have joined and habits they have completed. The event will have an array of users joined (members) and habits completed. The habit completed will have the owner (user that created the habit) and the associated event.
